Can't bind to 'ngClass' since it isn't a known property of 'header'
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
imports: [CommonModule],


The `*ngIf` directive was used in the template, but neither the `NgIf` directive nor the `CommonModule` was imported. Use Angular's built-in control flow @if or make sure that either the `NgIf` directive or the `CommonModule` is included in the `@Component.imports` array of this component.
